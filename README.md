A look at the natioanl MLS TV schedule
======================================

The MLS [released their national TV lineup](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/01/04/mls-unveils-2018-us-and-canada-national-broadcast-schedule) on Thursday, Jan. 4th.

I wanted to take a look at which teams will get the most national exposure while practicing skills using the [agate](agate.rtfd.org) data analysis package.

The result is inside the `/notebook/` folder.

Perhaps there will be a blog post later today.
