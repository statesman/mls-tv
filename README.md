A look at the national MLS TV schedule
======================================

The MLS [released their national TV lineup](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/01/04/mls-unveils-2018-us-and-canada-national-broadcast-schedule) on Thursday, Jan. 4th.

I wanted to take a look at which teams will get the most national exposure while practicing skills using the [agate](agate.rtfd.org) data analysis package.

The result is in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/statesman/mls-tv/blob/master/notebook/MLS%20TV%20time.ipynb) inside the `/notebook/` folder.

This was used in Chris Bils' story [Columbus Crew SC schedule provides limited exposure for Texas audience](http://www.statesman.com/sports/columbus-crew-schedule-provides-limited-exposure-for-texas-audience/Um8mpSm4HisuWR9ieEeXVI/)
